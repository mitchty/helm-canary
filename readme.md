# helm-canary

This isn't really intended to be an application anyone should use for anything "real". This is more a helm app one could use to view an applications changes and how those reflect into a helm chart and container versions.

Note this "app" is also in v0.0.0 of the application uses a *very* old version of python+alpine linux as well as the python dependencies are rather outdated. The lineage of this app is from another demo app I abused for similar purposes.

Note I may periodically rebase this entire repo as time goes on and I find out better ways to do things and/or add unit tests or other changes.
